## 🚀 About

**Caesium Image Compressor** is a free, open-source, modern tool for compressing and optimizing images. Caesium helps
you store, send, and share digital pictures by dramatically reducing their file size while preserving visual quality.
The application supports JPG, PNG, WebP and TIFF formats, as well as batch processing, resizing, and much more.

Caesium v3 is a complete rewrite using [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) and a React-based interface.

## ✨ Features

- Compress images (JPG, PNG, WebP, TIFF) with adjustable quality
- Batch processing and folder drag-and-drop
- Preview before/after compression
- Retain or remove EXIF metadata
- Easily resize images
- Adjustable multi-core performance
- Modern, easy-to-use interface
- Multilingual support
- Fully cross-platform: Windows, macOS, and Linux
